Just some notes along the way of learing and making this site:


 - I had problems with scaling the #BIG (div) to fit my mobile
   screen and found out that you can use the ' max-width ' css style.. :)


 - To position the .divJS (divs) in the middle i used ' display:inline-blick; '
   

 - Making the .infoDropdown was a bit of a trick, but an easy trick when
   you know that the only thing you need 2 use is ' diplay:none; '


ThePhp:

 - I found this helping module for printing just the hostname of the saved url
   http://php.net/parse_url
